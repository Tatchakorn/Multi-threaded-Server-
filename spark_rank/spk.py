'''
- Implement the PageRank algorithm with Spark 
and provide suitable input to test it.

- Given a set of house owners information in the 
format: 
    - OwnerID, HouseID, Zip, Value

- Write a Spark program to compute the average 
house value of each zip code.

- Write a Spark program to compute the inverted 
index of a set of documents. 
More specifically, 
given a set of (DocumentID, text) pairs, output a 
list of (word, (doc1, doc2, â€¦)) pairs.
