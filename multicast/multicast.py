Distributed Systems Assignment #3

Assignment 3: Python TCP, 
UDP and Multicasting
1. Try out the Python TCP/UDP client-server and 
multithreaded server examples. Correct any problem.
2. Try out the Python multicast example. Correct any 
problem.
3. Write simple TCP/UDP calculate servers that accept 
simple arithmetic computing requests in prefix form such 
as “+ 4 5” and send back the result. Write 
corresponding clients to test them.
4. Using Python multicast, write a client that sends out 10 
messages to a multicast group and another client that 
receives the messages. Give a few tests to see if all 
messages were correctly received.
